# Questions
**1.  What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Just learning about the idea of accelerating machine learning algorithms was very interesting. This is the first time I have optimized an ML model without tweaking the model itself, but by understanding how the hardware actually processes the procedures.
**2.  Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
We have been working on accelerating specific models, but I wonder if there is a process that could work for all types of models. That could different variations of the architectures of the same models, or for completely different network frameworks.
**3.  What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Learning some broader background about hardware acceleration first. I enjoyed learning by immediately diving into the project at hand (I think this is the best way to learn), however I think getting some general lectures about hardware acceleration and how it is applied to various sectors would have been an interesting start.
**4.  What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
We have mainly focused on the hardware acceleration of the prediction phase of a model. I would be interested in seeing how we can speedup the training process as well.
